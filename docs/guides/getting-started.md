# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the
`vite-plugin-remix-router` plugin in your Vite project. You can
[start with a new project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project)
or add the plugin to an existing project.

## Step 1: Installation

First, install `vite-plugin-remix-router` and `react-router-dom` packages:

```bash
npm install --save-dev vite-plugin-remix-router react-router-dom
```

```bash
yarn add --dev vite-plugin-remix-router react-router-dom
```

```bash
pnpm add --dev vite-plugin-remix-router react-router-dom
```

Then, add the plugin to your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import RemixRouter from 'vite-plugin-remix-router'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    RemixRouter({
      // configuration options
    }),
  ],
})
```

## Step 2: Define your first route

Create a `hello.tsx` file in the `src/routes` directory with the following
contents. This directory contains all your application routes, and you can
change it in the [plugin's configuration options](/config/reference).

```bash
mkdir src/routes && touch src/routes/hello.tsx
```

```tsx
// src/routes/hello.tsx

export function Component() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
      <p>Powered by Vite, React, and vite-plugin-remix-router</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Step 3: Create a Router instance

Create a `router.ts` file in the `src` directory and add the following:

```ts
import { createBrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import { routes } from 'virtual:routes'

export const router = createBrowserRouter(routes)
```

The `virtual:routes` export is generated by the `vite-plugin-remix-router` and
contains all the routes defined in your `src/routes`.

To use the data APIs in `react-router^6.4.0`, you should use the
`createBrowserRouter` to create a router instance. Check out the
[Picking a Router guide in React Router documentation](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/routers/picking-a-router)
to learn more.

If you are using typescript, add the following to your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["vite-plugin-remix-router/client"]
  }
}
```

Finally, import and pass the router instance to the `RouterProvider` component:

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom'
import { router } from './router'

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </Suspense>
  )
}
```

## Step 4: Start the development server

Now you can start the development server and visit
`http://localhost:5173/hello`.

## What's next?

By now, you should be able to install the `vite-plugin-remix-router` plugin and
create a new route. Next, we'll learn how to
[define application routes](/guides/defining-routes).

You can also check the [configuration reference](/config/reference) for
customizing the plugin's behavior.
